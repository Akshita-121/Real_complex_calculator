# Real_complex_calculator
Overview:
It is a versatile calculator implemented in C that handles both real and complex number operations. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on both real numbers and complex numbers.

How It Works:
The calculator prompts the user to select the type of number they want to work with: real or complex. Based on the selection, the user can perform the desired operation.

Real Number Operations:
For real numbers, the user enters two numbers and chooses the operation to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program then displays the result.

Complex Number Operations:
For complex numbers, the user is prompted to enter both the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. The program then performs the selected operation(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)and outputs the result in the form of a complex number.
